With this setup:

Your raw Excel data (data/*.xlsx) wonâ€™t be committed.

Your generated exports (output/*.json) are ignored (unless you want them tracked â€” then remove that line).

Keeps your repo clean from virtual envs, cache files, and IDE settings.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to set it up so that only scripts (like scripts/) and configs (requirements.txt, environment.yml) are tracked, while data + outputs are always ignored?
